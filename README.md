Churn Analysis with Machine Learning
=======
This Python script performs churn analysis using various machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn based on provided features. Churn analysis is crucial for businesses to understand and mitigate customer attrition, thus retaining valuable customers and optimizing business strategies.

Features
=====
+ Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded using pandas, and preprocessing steps such as dropping irrelevant columns (customer_id), encoding categorical variables (country, gender), and scaling numerical features are performed.
+ Model Training and Evaluation: The script trains multiple machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers.
+ Model Evaluation: Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the performance of each model.
+ Confusion Matrix and Classification Report: Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to provide detailed insights into the model's performance in predicting churn.
+ ROC Curve: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are plotted to visualize the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate for each classifier.

Usage
====
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the churn_analysis.py script with Python, providing the path to your dataset.
